# Real-Time High-Resolution Background Matting

![Teaser](https://github.com/PeterL1n/Matting-PyTorch/blob/master/images/teaser.gif?raw=true)

Official repository for the paper [Real-Time High-Resolution Background Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07810). Our model requires capturing an additional background image and produces state-of-the-art matting results at 4K 30fps and HD 60fps on an Nvidia RTX 2080 TI GPU.

**Disclaimer**: The video conversion script in this repo is not meant be real-time. Our research's main contribution is the neural architecture for high resolution refinement and the new matting datasets. The `inference_speed_test.py` script allows you to measure the tensor throughput of our model, which should achieve real-time. The `inference_video.py` script allows you to test your video on our model, but the video encoding and decoding is done without hardware acceleration and parallization. For production use, you are expected to do additional engineering for hardware encoding/decoding and loading frames to GPU in parallel. For more architecture detail, please refer to our paper.

## Demo

#### Scripts

We provide several scripts in this repo for you to experiment with our model. More detailed instructions are included in the files.
* `inference_images.py`: Perform matting on a directory of images.
* `inference_video.py`: Perform matting on a video.
* `inference_webcam.py`: An interactive matting demo using your webcam.

#### Notebooks
Additionally, you can try our notebooks in Google Colab for performing matting on images and videos.

* [Video matting (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y9zWfULc8-DDTSsCH-pX6Utw8skiJG5s?usp=sharing)

#### Virtual Camera
We provide a demo application that pipes webcam video through our model and outputs to a virtual camera. The script only works on Linux system and can be used in Zoom meetings. For more information, checkout:
* [Webcam plugin](https://github.com/andreyryabtsev/BGMv2-webcam-plugin-linux)

&nbsp;

## Usage / Documentation

You can run our model using **PyTorch**, **TorchScript**, **TensorFlow**, and **ONNX**. For detail about using our model, please check out the [Usage / Documentation](doc/model_usage.md) page.

&nbsp;

## Training

Configure `data_path.pth` to point to your dataset. The original paper uses `train_base.pth` to train only the base model till convergence then use `train_refine.pth` to train the entire network end-to-end. More details are specified in the paper.

## Tips

* When converting torch model to onnx, set pytorch verison to 1.6.0 or less because "IF" node cannot convert tensorRT7.
=======
* [After Effects Plug-In](https://aescripts.com/goodbye-greenscreen/)

## export onnx

* export_onnx.pyでtorch-modelをonnxに変換する.

```python
    pip3 install onnxruntime
    # Convert to onnx (for TensorRT 7)
    python export_onnx.py \
        --model-type mattingrefine \
        --model-checkpoint "PATH_TO_MODEL_CHECKPOINT" \
        --model-backbone resnet50 \
        --model-backbone-scale 0.25 \
        --model-refine-mode full \
        --resolution 1920 1080 \
        --onnx-opset-version 11 \
        --precision float32 \
        --output "export_model.onnx" \
        --validate
```
* onnxの画サイズ固定するためonnx-simplerで整える.

```python
    pip3 install onnx-simplifier
    python3 -m onnxsim export_model.onnx export_model-simplifier.onnx
    # Or call onnx files at once
    python3 run-onnx-simplifier.py
```

* export_model-simplifier.onnxをTensorRTへ.
